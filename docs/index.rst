Elk - A waveform catalogue tool
===============================

`Elk` is a python package designed to make working with numerical relativity waveforms easier in gravitational wave analyses.

Often numerical relativity data is distributed simply as files, or stored in a directory of files.
`Elk` provides a means of accessing these easily using Python, and make handling these data, and performing processing and reduction on them easier.
