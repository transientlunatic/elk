A Python package for managing and interacting with gravitational waveform catalogues.
Elk was initially designed to make working with numerical relativity catalogues easier.
These are normally distributed as directories full of HDF5 files, and can be a bit cumbersome to deal with.
Elk browses the contents of these directories and can assemble a catalogue based on the files in it.
